## Introduction

Fast decoding techniques serve as the linchpin for realizing the ambitious data rates of 5G networks. Among these, the Successive Cancellation (SC) algorithm stands out as the original solution to the challenges posed by Polar Codes. This groundbreaking algorithm has undergone further refinement, paving the way for the development of sophisticated list and flip decoders.

**Project POCO** is an advanced simulation environment specifically designed for SC decoding of Polar Codes. Leveraging state-of-the-art decoding techniques sourced from the literature, our simulator is tailored to provide an unparalleled understanding and analysis of Polar Code decoding processes.

## Features

- **Enhanced Reconfigurability Support:**
  The POCO simulator can work with any polar code with size $2^n, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, including but not limited to, 5G polar codes or any other reliability order of the user's choice.

- **Fast and Simplified Decoding Support:**
  The POCO simulator encapsulates the simplified and fast decoding techniques which made polar decoders practical in the first place. 

- **Fixed/Floating Point Support:**
  With enabled fixed point support, hardware approximate performance curves can be obtained for quantizations of user's choice.

- **Fast Turnaround Time:**
  Each performance plot point may take time based on specific configurations. Speedups at various points of the algorithm are employed, including but not limited to:
  - Batch operation support to bundle operations alike
  - Bypass decoding where result is guaranteed.

- **Performance Plot Visualization:**
  Using Python's matplotlib library, performance plots for bit/frame error rates can be obtained upon successful completion of the simulation.


## Getting Started

Guide users through the process of setting up and running your project.

### Prerequisites

The following Python libraries are required:

- **numpy** (version 1.21.2)
  ```bash
  pip install numpy==1.21.2
  ```
- **matplotlib** (version 3.4.3)
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib==3.4.3
  ```

By experience, make sure you are using the correct Python Interpreter in case the installed packages are unrecognized.

### Installation

No complex installation procedures are required beyond ensuring the prerequisite libraries are in place. If you're a VSCode user, open the repository as a folder (project) and execute the `main.py` script. Our script utilizes JSON files for configuration, and a plethora of examples are readily available for users to explore and leverage.

### Usage

The simulation setup is carried out using the `config.json` file. An example snapshot is provided below:

```json
{
    "filepath_polar_rel_idx" : "src/lib/ecc/polar/3gpp/n1024_3gpp.pc",
    "info_bit_length" : 512,

    "snr_start" : 1,
    "snr_end" : 3,
    "snr_step" : 0.25,
    
    "num_frames" : 10000,
    "num_errors" : 50,
    "num_max_fr" : 1000000,

    "qbits_enable" : 0,
    "qbits_chnl"   : 5,
    "qbits_intl"   : 6,
    "qbits_frac"   : 1,

    "plot_enable"  : 0,

    "fast_r0_enable" : 1,
    "fast_r1_enable" : 1,
    "fast_rep_enable" : 1,
    "fast_spc_enable" : 1,
    "fast_0011_enable" : 0,
    "fast_0101_enable" : 0,

    "fast_r0_max_size" : 1024,
    "fast_r1_max_size" : 1024,
    "fast_rep_max_size" : 1024,
    "fast_spc_max_size" : 1024
}
```
